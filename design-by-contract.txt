Design by contract presentation

Contract of a function
input -> function -> output

Contract of constructor injection
collaborators -> constructor -> instance

Unintended consequences of not designing by contract
* expose a feature not asked for because the implementation is easy
** this ties you to the implementation detail, and you won't be able to move away from it once the users get used to it
