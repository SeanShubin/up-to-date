Will help keep your maven project dependencies up to date

This is a work in progress.  This readme will be updated when it is in a functional state.

Currently you will not be able to compile the console module without setting up [dependency analyzer](https://github.com/SeanShubin/dependency-analyzer) and [dot](http://graphviz.org) first.

If dependency analysis is not important to you, you can just disable the exec-maven-plugin entry in the console module

Design by Contract Presentation

- Maintainable Code
- Easy to Test
- Design By Contract
    - Object-Oriented Software Construction - Bertrand Meyer
        - Pre-conditions
        - Post-conditions
        - Invariants
    - Contract of a function
        - input -> function -> output
    - Contract of constructor injection
        - collaborators -> constructor -> instance
- Should x be behind a contract?
    - Sometimes this is a judgment call, sometimes there is a correct answer
    - If the code is more comprehensible as a unit, it should not be split into contracts
    - If the code is talking to something you do not control, it should be placed behind a contract, for example
        - system clock
            - if the system clock is only accessed once, pass an argument instead
            - if the system clock is accessed at different times, you need a contract
        - environment variable
            - if you are not changing them while running, pass them in as parameters
        - local time zone
        - random
        - network
        - filesystem
        - database
        - implementation details unrelated to need
- Bad examples
    - Example of system clock
    - Example of environment variable
    - Example of implemented details unrelated to need
        - Expose the syntax of our search to end customers
        - Now we have to emulate that syntax if we change our implementation
- Good examples
