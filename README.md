Will help keep your maven project dependencies up to date

This is a work in progress.  This readme will be updated when it is in a functional state.

Currently you will not be able to compile the console module without setting up [dependency analyzer](https://github.com/SeanShubin/dependency-analyzer) and [dot](http://graphviz.org) first.

If dependency analysis is not important to you, you can just disable the exec-maven-plugin entry in the console module
