    - the rules sean uses
- why design by contract?
    - code should be easy to maintain
    - it is more important for code to be easy to maintain than it is for code to be easy to write, because you write it once, you maintain it forever
- what makes code easy to maintain?
    - how soon you get feedback
        - compile time
        - fast tests (such as unit tests)
        - slow tests (such as integration tests)
        - full tests (such as end-to-end tests, smoke tests, selenium tests)
        - run time
    - easy to debug
        - breakpoints
        - stack trace
    - always ask, "how to I test that?".  The answer should be simple.
- ideal
    - constructor injection (use constructor functions if your language does not have constructors)
    - single entry point
    - Wiring
        - [ProductionRunnerWiring](console/src/main/scala/com/seanshubin/up_to_date/console/ProductionRunnerWiring.scala)
        - Statically typed
        - Compiled
            - no scanning xml files at run time
            - no scanning .class files at run time
        - Breakpoints
        - No proxies in stack trace
        - Can follow the code in IDE

- reality
    - service locator
    - multiple entry points
        - servlets
        - java server pages
        - struts actions
        - spring controllers
- the incremental transition from the reality to the ideal
    - pull logic out of entry points
        - entry points are hard to test without a smoke test or end-to-end test
        - with only one logic path per entry point, you will only need one smoke test or end-to-end test per entry point
    - put wiring at the top level
    - make each entry point delegate to wiring
    - find most top level class not counting entry point and wiring
        - remove cycles
        - invert dependencies
        - since you are so close to the top level, the caller should already have access to wiring
    - find a usage of service locator
        - remove cycles
        - invert dependencies
        - they will bubble up
        - repeat at each calling class
- how to invert dependencies
    - make a copy of the class, with Impl appended to the name
    - make the original class an interface, and delete its contents
    - have the copy implement the interface
    - fix the compiler errors
    - you will eventually hit an entry point
    - use wiring to inject the dependencies from here
- don't need to invert dependencies in some cases
    - values
        - immutable
    - pure functions
        - referentially transparent
        - communicate through values
        - no observable side effects
- rules I have yet to find an exception to
    - put all integration points behind contracts
    - no mixing logic and integration
    - pass values rather than contracts when you have a choice
        - http request/response
    - anything that can see the current time goes behind a contract
    - anything that can see environment variables goes behind a contract
